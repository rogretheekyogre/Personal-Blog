# Personal-Blog
https://rogretheekyogre.github.io/Personal-Blog/

In this particular assignment, I had to create a blog with dark mode, alert prompt and the ability to
see locally stored data on the submit form. I accomplished this with the help of my tutor, ask bcs and
online resources.
The user should be able to, Toggle between light and dark mode, Enter text in the text boxes, use the submit form
to save local data and finally on the last page see the link to my perosal portfolio.
